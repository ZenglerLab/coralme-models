This is a repository containing all ME-models reconstructed using `coralME`_.

Automatically reconstructed ME-models (dME-models) are available in clean/, and updated ME-models (uME-models) are available in published/. We here provide JSON files for reconstructed (step2) and troubleshot (step3) ME-models. For uME-models, step2 and step3 are the same model, just that step3 will have a solution property.

Code to reproduce Figures of our manuscript and to reconstruct ME-models are provided here as python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
